PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
TicTacToe-CX is a professional-grade Tic Tac Toe game in C. 
It features CLI and basic GUI modes, single-player (AI), local two-player, and LAN multiplayer. 
It is cross-platform, can be compiled into standalone binaries using CMake, and focuses on gameplay and networking without media assets for simplicity.

FEATURES
--------

1. Game Modes:
   - Single Player vs AI
     * Easy: random moves
     * Medium: blocks and tries to win
     * Hard: Minimax algorithm (unbeatable)
   - Two Player (Local)
     * Play on the same machine
     * Option to choose X/O
   - LAN Multiplayer
     * Host/Join system via TCP sockets
     * Real-time board sync
     * Optional in-game text chat

2. User Interfaces:
   - CLI Mode:
     * ASCII board
     * Clear input prompts
   - Basic GUI Mode:
     * Simple window with clickable board (SDL2 or GTK optional)
     * Highlight current turn or winning line
     * Minimalist design (no images/sounds for now)

3. Game Features:
   - Board sizes: 3x3 (classic), optional 4x4 or 5x5
   - Win detection: horizontal, vertical, diagonal
   - Undo/Redo moves
   - Score tracking: wins, losses, draws (saved in highscores.txt)
   - Time-limited moves (optional timer per turn)
   - Custom symbols (X/O, letters or ASCII)

4. Networking (LAN Mode):
   - Server/Client architecture
   - Automatic board synchronization
   - Optional simple text chat
   - Auto reconnect on connection loss

5. Technical Features:
   - Cross-platform compilation: Linux, Windows, macOS
   - Build system: CMake for binary compilation
   - Config file (config.ini) for default settings (board size, AI difficulty, themes)
   - Modular code structure:
     * main.c
     * cli.c / cli.h
     * gui.c / gui.h
     * ai.c / ai.h
     * network.c / network.h
     * utils.c / utils.h
   - Proper resource management and clean exit
   - Can be compiled into standalone binaries for distribution

6. Fun / Extra Features:
   - Animated AI thinking (ASCII or simple GUI highlight)
   - Achievements / badges (text-based)
   - Replay mode of past games
   - Optional custom rules (e.g., connect 4 on 4x4 board)

---

ERROR HANDLING
--------------
Areas where errors can occur and should be handled gracefully:

1. User Input:
   - Invalid board positions
   - Invalid symbol selections
   - Invalid menu choices

2. File Operations:
   - Config file missing
   - Highscore file read/write errors

3. Network Operations (LAN mode):
   - Host unreachable / wrong IP
   - Connection lost during game
   - Packet send/receive failures
   - Multiple clients trying to connect to host

4. Memory Management:
   - Failed allocations for dynamic arrays (board, moves)
   - Leaks during undo/redo or game resets

5. GUI:
   - Failed window creation
   - Input events outside expected range

6. AI:
   - Edge cases in Minimax algorithm (prevent infinite recursion)
   - Invalid board state passed to AI

BUILD AND CROSS-PLATFORM
------------------------
- Use CMake to generate platform-specific build files:
    * Windows: Visual Studio or MinGW
    * Linux: Makefiles with gcc/clang
    * macOS: Xcode or Makefiles
- Command example:
    > mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build .
- Produces standalone binaries for distribution
- Optional tools for enhanced builds: Ninja, pkg-config, SDL2/GTK dev packages

---

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------
- Online multiplayer over the Internet
- Adaptive AI learning
- Replay export to text or simple logs
- GUI improvements with optional visuals later
- Voice commands for GUI

---

WHY IT'S EXCITING
-----------------
- Combines AI, CLI, GUI, and networking in one project
- Cross-platform and distributable as binaries
- Simple, fun, and highly replayable
- Professional structure, modular and extensible
- Great learning experience in C programming, memory management, and socket programming
